<h2>What is Apex Kit?</h2>
<p>
	I&#39;m a woodworker by hobby. One of the unique things about woodworking,
	is we often spend a lot of time making Jigs. Jigs are ... job helpers,
	designed to make a tricky cut repeatable and safe. Making a tapered table
	leg? There&#39;s a jig for that. Need to drill the same hole in the same
	spot in 12 pieces of wood? There&#39;s a jig for that.
</p>
<p>
	Apex kit is a series of &#39;jigs&#39; to make Salesforce software
	development faster, safer and more repeatable. As such, nothing in this
	repository is truly necessary. You can write triggers without this (or any)
	trigger framework. You can harness Queueables, make queries and callouts
	etc. all without Apex kit. That said, Apex kit exists to keep us all from
	re-inventing the wheel. Can you use triggers without it&#39;s trigger
	framework? Yes, but this will save you time, and effort. Or at least
	that&#39;s the value prop.
</p>
<p>
	That said, Apex Kit consists of a number of &#39;libraries&#39; that can be
	used independently of one another, though they&#39;re designed to work
	together.
</p>
<h3>Specifically Apex Kit contains:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>
		Feature Flags: A library for gating features and functionality for
		specific users. Supports gating based on org wide on/off, permission
		sets and custom permissions.
	</li>
	<li>
		Log: a bullet proof logging solution thats guaranteed to log, even when
		a transaction fails, or an exception occurs.
	</li>
	<li>
		OrgShape: a class for inspecting the current runtime environment, and
		the features / functionality the org has enabled. This includes a number
		of polyfill methods to determine or synthesize information about your
		org.
	</li>
	<li>
		Ouroboros - (Needs a better name): This is a library for developing
		Queueable jobs that self-re-enqueue until a given condition is met. In
		other words, this helps you build classes of work that can process
		massive quantities of data, one chunk at a time.
	</li>
	<li>
		Polyfills: Polyfills contains methods Salesforce should have provided,
		but doesn&#39;t. Look here before implementing a method you
		<em>thought</em> already existed only to find out Salesforce doesn&#39;t
		provide it.
	</li>
	<li>
		Promises: This library helps you write chainable bits of discrete
		asynchronous work that are executed in order. Effectively, it provides
		developers Javascript Promises, but in Apex. Super powerful, and
		flexible, especially for long-chains of API calls.
	</li>
	<li>
		Query Lib: A library for making SOQL and SOSL queries via a
		builder-style API / DSL. While not necessary, QueryLib queries enforce
		CRUD/FLS security.
		<em>this library is tightly coupled to Safely(see below), for now</em>
	</li>
	<li>
		Quiddity: (I didn&#39;t name this one. That&#39;s on Salesforce) A
		library for inspecting the runtime execution context of the current
		transaction. Additionally provides gating functionality allowing
		developers using it to prevent code paths in select execution contexts.
		i.e.: don&#39;t run this code in a user-driven context.
	</li>
	<li>
		Rest Library: This library provides a consistent abstraction for making
		REST callouts. Either on a one-off basis, or at on a complete API
		integration level. (see wiki for examples).
	</li>
	<li>
		Safely: Safely has two parts - first, a user permission checking library
		called &#39;canTheUser&#39; which helps developers determine crud and
		fls at runtime. The second part, &#39;Safely&#39;, wraps DML calls in
		Apex Security Decision objects - stripping fields and objects the user
		doesn&#39;t have access to. This library makes it super simple to safely
		make DML calls.
	</li>
	<li>
		Test Utilities: Contains a test data factory, a HTTP Callout Mock
		factory, and a Stubbing library that enables developers to define a
		stub/mock declaratively, there in their test. Deprecates so much
		boilerplate.
	</li>
	<li>
		Trigger Framework: is, well, a trigger framework. This one is controlled
		entirely through custom metadata and has built in support for per-user
		bypass. <em>helpful for mass data imports</em>
	</li>
	<li>
		ULID: This is a library for generating Universally Unique
		Lexicographically Sortable Identifiers. These are similar in concept to
		UUID&#39;s but are sortable, because the first 10 digits are a Crockford
		encoded timestamp.
	</li>
</ul>
<h2>Design Philosophy</h2>
<p>Apex Kit strives to stick to the following design principes.</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		Be as simple as possible. But no simpler. - Which is to say, you may not
		find that ApexKit does everything you want, but you are probably
		unlikely to think Apex Kit&#39;s solutions are &#39;too heavy&#39;.
	</li>
	<li>
		Be as easy to use as possible. To that end, way to much thought has been
		put into method and class names. The goal is to build as close to an
		english-sentence like API. At times this isn&#39;t exactly possible. For
		instance, Safely&#39;s API for DML Insert sadly can&#39;t simply be
		called <code>insert</code> because <code>insert</code> is a reserved
		word. So Safely&#39;s method name for insert is <code>doInsert</code>.
	</li>
	<li>
		Be as declarative as possible. - Apex Kit makes heavy use of the Builder
		pattern, or Fluent interface.This makes use of these libraries very
		expressive and declarative.
	</li>
	<li>
		Where possible, be configurable outside of code. Thus, much of what Apex
		Kit brings to the table over other libraries is the use of Custom
		Metadata Type records for configuration.
	</li>
	<li>(Working on this one) Consistent api for extensions.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Why Apex Kit?</h2>
<p>
	There&#39;s a ton of really good open source Apex libraries. Stalwarts of
	the community like NovaLog or FFLib. There&#39;s nothing wrong with these
	and I didn&#39;t create Apex Kit because they&#39;re bad/wrong/deficient.
</p>
<p>
	Much of Apex Kit started out life as parts of my work for Apex Recipes when
	I worked as a Salesforce Developer Advocate (I got better). Apex Recipes is
	designed to be &quot;teaching code&quot;. Ie: code that may not be the most
	useful, in production, but helps teach developers to use the platform and
	the Apex language. Apex Kit is the production ready version of that teaching
	code; plus some extras.
</p>
<p>
	I recognize there&#39;s plenty of ways to solve just about any problem, and
	I&#39;m not so arrogant to believe Apex Kit&#39;s the best, or only way to
	solve these problems. I do, however, have enough of an ego to think Apex Kit
	is a <em>good set</em> of solutions.
